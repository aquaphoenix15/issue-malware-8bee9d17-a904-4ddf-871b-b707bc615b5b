### NOT A VIRUS ###
***THIS IS NOT A VIRIUS BUT A JOKE VIRUS***

Ive uploaded the source code to prove it is not an actual virus but merely something that makes it LOOK like a virus. Check the source code I will add a comment on each line describing what it does. If you want to be perfectly safe, run it in a VM to prove the point. It just LOOKS like a virus and makes a bunch of popups. In the source code you can change the `` variable to control how many popups it makes. This would only be a real virus if it were to execute so many times to overload the CPU. I made it 500 and that should only slow the PC to a point where it is annoying to close them all (assuming the CPU isn't a celron ,_,). If you want to change it it is coded in Java.
